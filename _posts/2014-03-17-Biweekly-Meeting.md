We said we'd do more socializing as a group, so that's the theme of Monday's
meeting!  So come to the Makerspace at 6:30 PM to talk, drink (we'll have
beverages, but feel free to bring your own -- alcohol is okay), and eat.


#### Detailed directions to the Makerspace:

The Makerspace is located in the Urbana-Champaign Independent Media Center (basement),
202 S. Broadway Ave., Urbana
(same building as the post office that's right by Lincoln Square Mall)

The Makerspace is a bit of a challenge to find, but we'll have
signs up. We'll also be keeping an eye on this mailing list and
info@py-cu.org (and our Meetup messages and our Facebook
group and all the other places...) so contact us if you find the building
but can't find the room.

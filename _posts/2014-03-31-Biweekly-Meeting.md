Today's meeting will probably be a short one. We'll be discussing moving our
general meetings to occur once-monthly and probably changing the venue as well
(hack night time and location will remain the same). 

#### Detailed directions to the Makerspace:

The Makerspace is located in the Urbana-Champaign Independent Media Center (basement),
202 S. Broadway Ave., Urbana
(same building as the post office that's right by Lincoln Square Mall)

The Makerspace is a bit of a challenge to find, but we'll have
signs up. We'll also be keeping an eye on this mailing list and
info@py-cu.org (and our Meetup messages and our Facebook
group and all the other places...) so contact us if you find the building
but can't find the room.

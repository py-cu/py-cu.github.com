# When
Monday, September 15, 2014, 6:30 PM - 8:30 PM
<br> <br>

# Where
Champaign Public Library, Robeson Pavilion Room **C** (by the coffee shop area in the lobby)
<br> <br>

# Agenda

### Main presentation
Liz Surbeck will discuss academic collaborative networks, using the biomedical
community as a case study and focusing on <a
href="http://biopython.org">BioPython</a>, a biological computation library,
and <a href="https://networkx.github.io/">NetworkX</a>, a package for studying complex networks.

In her own words:

> Our objectives will be:
> * What is a network graph?
> * When are network graphs useful and when are they not?
> * How do you build collaborative network graphs?
> * What are the advantages of BioPython in creating collaborative network graphs?
> * When do we come across roadblocks in creating network graphs with BioPython?
>
> Some useful docs:
> * http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html
> * http://networkx.github.io/

Liz will also present a troubleshooting teaser: *When strings and dictionaries collide!* 
<br> <br>

### And, as always:
* Today I Learned
* Birds of a feather (informal ad-hoc discussion groups)
* We'll wrap up by planning the next meeting, so stick around if you want to participate in Py-CU as an organizer.

#### Share your skills and pick up some new ones at our weekly hack sessions!
Join us at the Urbana-Champaign Independent Media Center (basement), 202 S. Broadway Ave.,
Urbana, from 7 to 9 PM. 

This is a weekly Py-CU event for people to work on projects, seek assistance on
projects, socialize, plan, and generally enjoy being around people who like to
code, too. Individuals of all levels of programming experience are encouraged
to come.

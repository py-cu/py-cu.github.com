### When
August 11, 2014, 6:30 PM - 8:30 PM

### Where
Champaign Public Library, Robeson Pavilion Room **B** (by the coffee shop area in the lobby)

### Agenda
* Demo showing how to deploy a <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> (a popular Python web framework) web application on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> (a cloud-based server solution for building and deploying web applications with a minimum of server management). This follows up on Chris's lightning talk from last month, in which he explained the basics of the Heroku philosophy.
* Continuing with the same theme, we'll compare Heroku to <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/">PythonAnywhere</a>, a kind-of-similar-but-not-really web hosting service.

### Also
* Meetup sponsors
* Birds of a feather (informal ad-hoc discussion groups)
* Group TIL-ing (Today I Learned)
* We'll wrap up by planning the next meeting, so stick around if you want to participate in Py-CU as an organizer.

### Planning ahead:
The next meeting will be September 15, 6:30 - 8:30 PM, Robeson Pavilion Room **C**, Champaign Public Library

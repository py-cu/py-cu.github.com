The theme for this meeting is "contributing to open source projects," featuring
talks by Roger Serwy and Sean Vig. Roger will discuss contributing to <a
href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/IDLE">IDLE, a popular Python IDE</a> and
Sean will talk about contributing to <a href="http://sympy.org/en/">SymPy, a
Python library for symbolic math</a>.

Other items on the agenda include
* a discussion on the state of our affiliation with Makerspace Urbana and other organizations;
* Google Glass updates;
* contributing a poster or two based on our experiences with the PyCuCamp
workshop (Python tutorials for beginners) to conferences like PyCon Canada and
the American Library Association's ALA 2014.

As usual, we'll conclude with break-out sessions.

*More detailed directions to the new meeting location: Applied Research
Associates is located at <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/DM3I1">100 Trade Centre
Dr.</a> (sort of by Kirby and State), Suite 200, in Champaign. Itâ€™s the same
building as Wolfram, and the entrance is on the SW corner of the building,
where the rotating doors are. Those will most likely be locked at that time,
but we'll have someone in the lobby to let you in.*

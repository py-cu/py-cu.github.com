# Agenda

### Main presentation: Fanfiction Story Analysis

Elizabeth will present her project using Python to scrape various fan fiction
archives for story text and metadata. Highlights: using <a

as replacement CSV writer, XPath, and regular expressions.


### And, as always:

* Today I Learned
* Birds of a feather (informal ad-hoc discussion groups)
* "Business"/organizational stuff
* We'll wrap up by planning the next meeting, so stick around if you want to participate in Py-CU as an organizer.

### We're turning one!

Help us celebrate our first birthday!

* Time: February 1st, 2014, 6 - 9 PM.
* Place: The Makerspace, at the Urbana-Champaign Independent Media Center (basement), 202 S. Broadway Ave., Urbana

This time last year, a bunch of random people came together and decided to start a Python users group and called it Py-CU after Nadia Karlinsky posted an ad in Craigslist about meeting fellow Py-CUrious folks.

Attendees are encouraged to bring eats and drinks of any kind though this is not necessary, especially for folks who have been wanting to come to one of our events but have been somewhat shy about doing so.

We'll also play games such as Cards Against Humanity and anything else people will bring. There will also be a lot of hanging out and getting to know each other. 
So stop by! We would love to see you!

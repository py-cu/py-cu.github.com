Two big changes:
1. We're now meeting once a month rather than once every two weeks, since meeting frequency and the amount of content we can offer per meeting are inversely correlated.
2. Our venue is once again at the Champaign Public Library. We're not guaranteeing that we'll stay there forever, though -- we might even meet in different places each month, just for the hell of it.


### Where
Champaign Public Library, Robeson Pavilion Room B (by the coffee shop area in the lobby)

### When
6:30 PM - 8:30 PM, Monday, May 12, 2014

### Agenda
The theme for this meeting is variety, since we'll have three quick talks on a range of topics. Read on for more details.

#### Lightning talks
* Liz Surbeck will do a book review on the soon-to-be-released book "Flask Web Development" by Miguel Grinberg from O'Reilly (http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920031116.do).
* Roger Serwy will talk about CPython bytecode.
* Tim Kuelhorn will demonstrate the basics of getting started on a project using Python.

#### Also
* Birds of a feather (informal ad-hoc discussion groups)
* Group TIL-ing
* Announcements and such about upcoming events
* We'll wrap up by planning the next meeting, so stick around if you want to
participate in Py-CU as an organizer.

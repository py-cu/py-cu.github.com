# Agenda

### Main presentation
Elizabeth Wickes will present "How I stopped failing at *Jeopardy!*," a follow-up to a previous talk about her game show data scraping and analysis project. The focus will be on the technical process of data scraping along with a summary of the results.  Topics will include <a href="http://scrapy.org">Scrapy (a Python web crawling framework)</a>, regular expressions, and XPath (a query language for addressing locations in an XML-based document).


### And, as always:

* Today I Learned
* Birds of a feather (informal ad-hoc discussion groups)
* "Business" stuff, including Meetup sponsorships
* We'll wrap up by planning the next meeting, so stick around if you want to participate in Py-CU as an organizer.

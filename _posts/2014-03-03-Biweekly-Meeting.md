### Our main talk:
The main talk: Chris Maden will talk about Python in the context of documentation and unit testing, including (the perils of) introspection, docstrings, doctest, and test-driven development.

### And, as always:

* Break out into Birds of a Feather groups
* Group TIL-ing (Today I Learned)
* Planning stuff: 
  
  * Pitch Night
  * Next meeting

*Please note that we're now meeting at the Makerspace, as we are more formally associated with them at this point*


#### Detailed directions to the Makerspace:

The Makerspace is located in the Urbana-Champaign Independent Media Center (basement),
202 S. Broadway Ave., Urbana
(same building as the post office that's right by Lincoln Square Mall)

The Makerspace is a bit of a challenge to find, but we'll have
signs up. We'll also be keeping an eye on this mailing list and
info@py-cu.org (and our Meetup messages and our Facebook
group and all the other places...) so contact us if you find the building
but can't find the room.

Elizabeth was <a

about Py-CU</a>! An excerpt:

<blockquote style="font-style: italic; font-size: 0.85em">
From my perspective, computer programming has always been a communal activity. We need other people to help us solve problems, link us to learning materials, or work with us on larger projects. Very often programming appears and feels very solitary when our community is based solely on websites like Stack Overflow and Reddit or in a pile of books. Sometimes we want to have some face-to-face interaction so we can feel like we are part of a community. That is what Py-CU provides.

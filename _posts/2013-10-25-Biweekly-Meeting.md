New meeting place!  This time we're meeting at Applied Research Associates,
6:30-8:30 PM, Friday, October 25. This will be our last Friday meeting -- we'll
start meeting Mondays starting November 4th. Applied Research Associates is
located at <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/zHrEm">100 Trade Centre Dr.  (sort of by
Kirby and State), Suite 200, in Champaign</a>. It's the same building as Wolfram, and the entrance is on the SW corner of the building.

Liz will be giving our main talk on Google Glass. Through a series of fortunate events, she was able to purchase one and she invites Py-CU members to make this session an interactive one as we discuss how this new wave of mobile technology can impact our lives. There will be Glass playtime as well. App and project ideas are welcome :)

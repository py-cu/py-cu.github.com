#### Share your skills and pick up some new ones at our weekly open hours!
Join us at the Urbana-Champaign Independent Media Center (basement), 202 S. Broadway Ave.,
Urbana, every Saturday, 1 - 3 PM.

This is a weekly Py-CU event for people to work on projects, seek assistance on
projects, socialize, plan, and generally enjoy being around people who like to
code, too. Individuals of all levels of programming experience are encouraged
to come.

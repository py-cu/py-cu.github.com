Two big changes:

1. We’re now meeting once a month rather than once every two weeks, since meeting frequency and the amount of content we can offer per meeting are inversely correlated.
2. Our venue is once again at the Champaign Public Library, in a room off the coffeeshop area in the lobby. We’re not guaranteeing that we’ll stay there forever, though – we might even meet in different places each month, just for the hell of it.

Today we'll be following our new more structured format.

* 10 minutes for introductions

* 30 minutes for main talk and Q&A
or
* 3x10 minutes lightnight talks

This will be Roger's introduction of the Manual for Py-CU. From the last meeting notes, "The purpose of this document is to capture the necessary steps, leadership experience, etc, about the administrative requirements for running Py-CU, from web administration, group meetings, special events, etc."

* 10 minutes birds of a feather 

* 10 minutes of group TILing (Today I Learned)

* 20 minutes business/boring stuff

This will include followup from our meeting with Makerspace Urbana on December 1.

* 10 minutes planning for next time

*Detailed directions to the new meeting location: Applied Research
Associates is located at <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/DM3I1">100 Trade Centre
Dr.</a> (sort of by Kirby and State), Suite 200, in Champaign. Itâ€™s the same
building as Wolfram, and the entrance is on the SW corner of the building,
where the rotating doors are. Those will most likely be locked at that time,
but we'll have someone in the lobby to let you in.*

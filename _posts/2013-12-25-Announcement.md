Just a quick reminder that we'll be suspending our regular twice-monthly general meeting schedule until after the holiday season. Our next meeting will be January 6th. At that point we'll start meeting at the Makerspace each time, since we're now officially affiliated with the Makerspace and have full use of the space. Watch the events section for the meeting's agenda. See you there!

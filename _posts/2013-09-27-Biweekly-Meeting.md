Come join us at the Champaign Public Library, in our regular room this time
(Robeson Pavilion Room C, first floor lobby area, right across from the
coffeeshop stand), 6:30 PM - 8:30 PM.

**The agenda includes:**

* **Main presentation**

  Austin Rochford will talk about probabilistic programming with <a
  href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymc">PyMC</a>.

* **Choosing a new meeting time/day**

  Since we started Py-CU last February, our General Meetings have been every
  other Friday. Of course, this doesn’t work for everyone so we put up a Doodle
  poll and the majority of the votes given went to Monday nights. However,
  Nadia and Liz will be busy with the Python Beginner Tutorial series until the
  end of October. We need to figure out whether we will keep our General
  Meetings on Fridays until the series is over or if there are people who can
  fill in and lead meetings temporarily, through the end of October. *So if there is anyone who is willing
  to lead meetings on Mondays after our September 27 meeting, please email us
  <a href="mailto:info@py-cu.org?Subject=Temporarily%20leading%20PyCU%20meetings">info@py-cu.org</a>!*


* **Birds of a Feather sessions**

* **Lightning talks**

  We don't have a lightning talk this week, but we're up for anything, if
  you've got an idea for one.

* **Python coding challenges**

  We're exploring the idea of doing something like a Coding Dojo (i.e. "a
  meeting where a bunch of coders get together to work on a programming
  challenge. They are there have fun and to engage in Deliberate Practice \[the
  idea that in order to get better at something, you need to practice\] . . .
  focussing on coding in front of others, most often something from
  scratch, in a very short amount of time . . ."
  (<a
  href="http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?WhatIsCodingDojo">http://codingdojo.org</a>) -- i.e. some
  regular Python challenges during our meetings that are meant to help us all
  sharpen our Python skills. Here's <a
  href="https://github.com/py-cu/pycu-coding-challenges">our GitHub repository</a> with a couple easy example
  challenges and <a
  href="https://github.com/py-cu/pycu-coding-challenges/issues/1">some ideas
  for more involved challenges</a>. If you'd like to contribute, <a
  href="mailto:info@py-cu.org?Subject=PyCU%20coding%20dojo">email us at
  info@py-cu.org</a> and let us know.



* **Py-CU Camp Beginner Tutorials update**

  So far we've had two of our (in total six)
  <a href="http://py-cu.github.io/announcements/2013/08/28/Announcement.html">weekly tutorials</a>,
  and they're going well. They're even "fun," according to some participants.
  Check out our new <a href="http://py-curious.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>, where
  we're posting our lesson content as well as other relevant stuff. One of the
  best things about these is our high instructor/helper to student ratio, so if
  anyone with some experience in Python would like to come to these to help out
  on the ground, that would be awesome. The next tutorial is taking place this
  coming Monday, September 30th, 6:30 - 8:30 PM at <a
  href="http://cucfablab.org/">the Fab Lab</a>, located at <a
  href="http://goo.gl/maps/dKuLR">1301 S. Goodwin Ave. in Urbana</a>.

<h3>The talks</h3>

<h4>Jake Kreider, Director of Web Development at Granular</h4>
Granular’s tech stack and how we use Python (spoiler: a lot). He will touch on
our use of Pyramid and SQL Alchemy, and talk about tips for maintaining a large
codebase in Python.

<h4>Reza Farivar, Manager of Data Intelligence at Capital One</h4>
Deep learning has become one of the hottest topics in computing in the past few
years. Neural networks are not a new topic, but with the recent advances in
computation capacity provided by hardware accelerators, in particular GPUs,
they have gained new popularity. In this talk we present some of the concepts
behind neural networks and deep learning, and then shift to the performance
aspects of available solutions. We will finally focus on Tensorflow, an open
source deep learning package, and provide a hands-on demo using it that uses
the python language.

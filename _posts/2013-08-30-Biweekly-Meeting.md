Come join us at the Champaign Public Library, in our regular room this time
(Robeson Pavilion Room C, first floor lobby area, right across from the
coffeeshop stand), 6:30 PM - 8:30 PM.

**On the agenda:**

* Lightning talk: Henry Gabb will be talking about using Python ElementTree API to extract data from XML files.

* Main presentation: Elizabeth Wickes will talk about troubleshooting her web scraping program.
This is pretty exciting because this is a great opportunity to talk about times
when we have all run into coding issues and how we resolved them.

* Birds of a Feather sessions

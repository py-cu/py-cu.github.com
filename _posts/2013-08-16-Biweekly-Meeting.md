Come join us at the Champaign Public Library, in our regular room this time
(Robeson Pavilion Room C, first floor lobby area, right across from the
coffeeshop stand), 6:30 PM - 8:30 PM.

**On the agenda:**

* For our lightning talk, Paco Jain will discuss using Python in his research in
theoretical particle physics.
* Our main presentation will expand our minds with JavaScript, and then expand
our minds further by bringing in Python: Joey Trapp will contrast and compare
features of two popular web application frameworks:
[Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).
Here's Joey's summary:

> "Ember.js is a front-end JavaScript MVC framework for building ambitious web applications. Some of the concepts in Ember have a bit of a learning curve, and I will demonstrate those features by comparing or contrasting them to a similar feature in Django (where it applies). Along with the presentation, I will give a demonstration of setting up a simple Ember app, data bindings, computed properties, and if time permits, some build tool configurations that work well for me and my team."

* Birds of a Feather sessions

#### Main Talk: Notes

Last night [Susan Potter](https://github.com/mbbx6spp) presented a simple
live coding session on Flask, a Python micro web framework with unittest
integration.

Follow along with the notes by cloning the Gist's git repository like this:

```
git clone https://gist.github.com/6043797.git acktacular
cd acktacular
echo "following needed because Gists do not allow for subdirectories"
mkdir templates
mv welcome.html templates/
```

Susan plans on updating this Gist as she develops the idea of Acktacular
more.

Susan wrote up some notes on this live coding session in the
[Gist below](https://gist.github.com/mbbx6spp/6043797):

#### Main Talk: Notes

Last night [Susan Potter](https://github.com/mbbx6spp) presented a simple
live coding session on Flask, a Python micro web framework with unittest
integration.

Follow along with the notes by cloning the Gist's git repository like this:

{% highlight bash %}
$ git clone https://gist.github.com/6043797.git acktacular
$ cd acktacular
$ echo "following needed because Gists do not allow for subdirectories"
$ mkdir templates
$ mv welcome.html templates/
{% endhighlight %}

Susan plans on updating this Gist as she develops the idea of Acktacular
more.

Susan wrote up some notes on this live coding session in the
[Gist below](https://gist.github.com/mbbx6spp/6043797):

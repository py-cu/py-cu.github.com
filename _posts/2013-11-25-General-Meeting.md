At today's meeting we will have follow-up on the Strategic Plan Committee's meeting on Friday, including discussing a more consistent and structured meeting format, including TIL's, How I Work's, coding dojo's, etc. 

We will also have a meeting structure in a more formalized manner, meaning we
will have designated moments for a Main Talk, Lightening Talks, and
Birds-of-a-feather sessions. One of those sessions will be the Strategic
Planning Committee. 

*Detailed directions to the new meeting location: Applied Research
Associates is located at <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/DM3I1">100 Trade Centre
Dr.</a> (sort of by Kirby and State), Suite 200, in Champaign. It’s the same
building as Wolfram, and the entrance is on the SW corner of the building,
where the rotating doors are. Those will most likely be locked at that time,
but we'll have someone in the lobby to let you in.*

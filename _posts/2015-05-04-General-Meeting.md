# Agenda

### Main presentation: Django Best Practices we learned from developing the Compass Space Request Application, presented by Yoon Lee

> After completing the project to develop the Compass Space Request Application, we have learned many lessons and adopted the best practices developing with Django framework. Working on building Django projects last two years, we learned and exhausted many features of Django framework. Starting from demoing the live application, I will cover the following items in the presentation.

> * Documenting the requirements
> * Core Concepts of building Django projects
> * Settings and configuration files
> * Database/ Model best practices
> * Function and class-based views
> * Common patterns for forms
> * Template best practices
> * Building the web services
> * Working with the Django Admin

### And, as always:

* Today I Learned
* Birds of a feather (informal ad-hoc discussion groups)
* "Business"/organizational stuff
 * Quick discussion on other stuff we can do as a group (content, services, etc)
  * Specifically, how do we feel about offering code reviews? Logistics?
  * Meetup sponsorship
* We'll wrap up by planning the next meeting, so stick around if you want to participate in Py-CU as an organizer.

<br> <br>

# Where
Champaign Public Library, Foundation Conference Room (222, on the second floor)
<br> <br>

# Agenda

### Main presentation: IronPython

 &nbsp;<a href="http://ironpython.net/">IronPython</a> is Microsoft's implementation of Python, written entirely in C#. It easily integrates with the rest of the .NET framework and is fully compatible with other implementations of Python, including CPython.


### And, as always:

* Today I Learned
* Birds of a feather (informal ad-hoc discussion groups)
* "Business"/organizational stuff
* We'll wrap up by planning the next meeting, so stick around if you want to participate in Py-CU as an organizer.

# Planning ahead:
The next meeting will be January 12, 6:30 PM - 8:30 PM, Foundation Conference Room (222), Champaign Public Library

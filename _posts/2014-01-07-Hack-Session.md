#### Due to the severe weather on Monday, we moved the general meeting to today, combining it with our regular hack night event (7 - 9 PM).

Also note that starting today, we'll be holding all our general meetings at the Makerspace (at the Urbana-Champaign Independent Media Center (basement), 202 S. Broadway Ave., Urbana).

### Agenda for today's meeting:

* 10 minutes for introductions

* Usually reserved for 30 minutes for main talk and Q&A, but we don't have a main talk this time due to the crazy weather and other crazy things

* Nadia will give us a quick tour on using GitHub.

* 10 minutes birds of a feather 

* 10 minutes of group TILing (Today I Learned)

* 20 minutes business/boring stuff

* 10 minutes planning for next time

The rest of the time to be used for hanging out and working on whatever.

### About hack night:
This is a weekly Py-CU event for people to work on projects, seek assistance on
projects, socialize, plan, and generally enjoy being around people who like to
code, too. Individuals of all levels of programming experience are encouraged
to come.
